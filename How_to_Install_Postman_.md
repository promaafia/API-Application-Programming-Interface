# How to Install Postman?
We can install postman in two ways
- As a Native App
- As a Extension (Chrome/Firefox)
Let’s see how to install the Postman native app.

 
#### Step-1: 
Go to the link https://www.postman.com/downloads/ and click download for Mac or Windows or Linux based on your operating system.
#### Step-2: 
For downloading the app for Windows, click on the download button and select the particular version. I opted for the 64-bit version. If you are using a 32-bit OS, you can choose the 32 bit, as shown in the above image. 
#### Step-3: 
After downloading the .exe file, you need to install the application.
#### Step-4: 
Once the installation completes, you will be redirected to a window where you can click on Stop signing in and take me straight to the app (as this app can also be used without logging in) or otherwise you will get a new window to sign up.
It is better to create an account as this will help you to save the work you do within the Postman, and with this, you won't lose any work.
#### Step-5: 
Create your account with all the required details, or you can also signup with Google. 

*Note: I highly recommend you to create an account in the beginning itself. If you have an account, it will allow you to save your work that you do inside the postman. You won't lose any of your work.*
#### Step-6: 
After signing in, select the workspace tools as per your requirement, and then click on, continue to get the startup screen. 
#### Step-7: 
You are ready to use Postman.

# Steps to Update the Postman

- You can change the update settings by enabling the settings of automatically downloading major updates. 
- You can also check for the latest updates by clicking on Check for updates, which will show you if any new update is available.

- It automatically downloads minor updates and bug fixes.

# Troubleshooting Postman Updates
You may encounter issues updating in the Windows version of Postman 6.1. To resolve you must set the environmental variable as mentioned below.
- Go to ‘Control Panel’ – ‘System’
- Click on ‘Advanced System Settings’
- Click on ‘Advanced’ and then click on ‘Environment Variables’
- Click on ‘New’ under ‘System Variable’
- Add a ‘Variable name’ as ‘POSTMAN_DISABLE_GPU’ and ‘Variable value’ as ‘true’ and click on OK to save.
This is all about the installation of the Postman tool on the Windows system.

Postman is **an application used for API testing.** It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated.
