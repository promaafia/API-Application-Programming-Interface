# What is API? 

API represents the Application Programming Interface. An API is a bunch of programming codes, a middle person that permits two applications to converse with one another. It is a kind of Software Interface. In other words, an API is like a messenger that conveys your request to the supplier that you're mentioning it from and afterward conveys the reaction back to you. It also contains the terms of this data exchange.

APIs fill in as a reflection layer between two frameworks, concealing the intricacy and working subtleties of the last option. Application programming interfaces comprise of two parts: 
- Technical specification depicting the information trade convention 
- Programming interface kept in touch with the specialized detail

# Types of API
There are two categories of API. One is 

    APIs by availability release policies 
and another one is 

    APIs by use cases.

# APIs by Availability Release Policies

As far as Release Policies, APIs can be a 
- Private 
- Composite 
- Partner and 
- Public 

### Open/Public APIs. 
It is also called engineer confronting or outside, these APIs are accessible for any outsider designers. there are no limitations to getting to these sorts of APIs since they are openly accessible.

### Internal/Private APIs.
These application programming interfaces are intended for further developing arrangements and administrations inside an association. The association utilizes this sort of API among the distinctive inward groups to have the option to work on its items and administrations. 

### Partner APIs. 
Accomplice APIs are transparently advanced however imparted to colleagues who have consented to an arrangement with the distributor. An engineer needs explicit freedoms or licenses to get to this kind of API since they are not accessible to people in general. 

### Composite APIs. 
This sort of API joins various information and administration APIs. It is a grouping of errands that run simultaneously because of the execution, and are not in line with an undertaking. Its primary uses are to accelerate the course of execution and work on the presentation of the audience members in the web interfaces. 

| Who Use the API  | External Access | App Types | 
| :--------------: | :-------------: | :-------: | 
| Internal API (Internal Developers) | Lock  | B2E, A2A, B2B, B2C | 
| Partner, Customer API (Partner/Customer Developer)  | Need a Key  | B2B, B2C| 
| Open API (Developers Anywhere) | Open | B2C | 


| Abbreviation   | Description | 
| :------------: | :---------: | 
| A2A | Application-to-Application |
| B2B | Business to Business |
| B2C | Business-to-Consumer |
| B2E | Business-to-Employee |

# APIs by Use Cases

APIs can be characterized by the frameworks for which they are planned. 
- Data Set APIs.
- Operating systems APIs.
- Remote APIs.
- Web APIs.

### Data set APIs. 
Data set APIs to empower correspondence between an application and an information base administration framework. Designers work with information bases by composing questions to get to information, change tables, and so on. 

The **Drupal 7 Database API**, for instance, permits clients to compose bound together questions for various data sets, both exclusive and open-source (Oracle, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, CouchDB, and MSSQL). 

Another model is **ORDS Database API**, which is installed into Oracle REST Data Services.

### Operating systems APIs.

This gathering of APIs characterizes how applications utilize the assets and administrations of working frameworks. Each OS has its arrangement of APIs, for example, Windows API (Win API) or Linux API (kernel userspace API).

### Remote APIs.

Remote APIs characterize norms of cooperation for applications running on various machines. All in all, one programming item gets to assets situated external the gadget that demands them, which clarifies the name. Since two somewhat found applications are associated over a correspondences organization, especially the web, most distant APIs are composed dependent on web guidelines. Java Database Connectivity API and Java Remote Method Invocation API are two instances of distant application programming interfaces.

### Web APIs.

This API class is the most well-known. Web APIs give machine-comprehensible information and usefulness move between online frameworks which address customer server engineering. These APIs mostly convey demands from web applications and reactions from servers utilizing Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

# Example of APIs
Here are a few instances of notable APIs that utilization various conventions and particulars. Actually, take a look at their documentation to get more data and references.
- Universal Logins
- Third-Party Payment Processing
- Travel Booking Comparisons
- Google Maps
- Skyscanner Flight Search
- Weather API

# How an API Works?
An API is a bunch of characterized decisions that clarify how applications speak with each other. APIs sit between an application and the web server, going about as a go-between layer that processes information move between frameworks. 

Here's how an API function: 

- __A customer application starts an API__  to recover information also known as a solicitation. This solicitation is handled from an application to the web server through the APIs Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and incorporates a solicitation action word, headers, and here and there, a solicitation body. 

- __After getting a legitimate solicitation,__ the API settles on a decision to the outer program or web server. 

- __The server sends a response__ to the API with the mentioned data. 

- __The API moves the information__ to the underlying mentioned application. 

While the information move will vary contingent upon the web administration being utilized, this course of solicitations and reactions all occurs through an API. Though a UI is intended for use by people, APIs are intended for use by a PC or application. 

APIs offer security by the plan on the grounds that their situation as mediator works with the deliberation of usefulness between two systems API endpoint decouples the devouring application from the framework offering the support. Programming interface calls generally incorporate approval accreditations to lessen the danger of assaults on the server, and an API passage can restrict admittance to limit security dangers. Likewise, during the trade, HTTP headers, treats, or question string boundaries give extra security layers to the information. 

For instance, consider an API presented by an installment handling administration. Clients can enter their card subtleties toward the front of an application for an internet business store. The installment processor doesn't expect admittance to the client's ledger; the API makes an extraordinary token for this exchange and remembers it for the API call to the server. This guarantees a more elevated level of protection from potential hacking dangers.

# Why We Need APIs?
Regardless of whether you're overseeing existing devices or planning new ones, you can utilize an application programming interface to work on the cycle. A portion of the fundamental advantages of APIs incorporate the accompanying:

- Simpler development 
- Information adaptation 
- Further developed cooperation 
- Added security

# Modern E-commerce Site Use APIs

Online business APIs are utilized in numerous ways. From showing items on an internet-based store to transportation them everywhere. APIs assist proprietors with dealing with their internet-based business and associate with clients quickly and dependably.

- Site Search APIs 
- Product Data APIs 
- Payment/Installment APIs 
- Transportation APIs 
- Money transformation APIs

### Why This E-commerce SIte Use APIs

APIs offer a wide scope of advantages for Ecommerce Sites. They can assist consumers with effectively tracking down items, growing a company's brand, or even extending their acquiring potential by selling items on different commercial centers like __eBay__, __Amazon__, __Facebook__ and so on. Recorded beneath are a few advantages of why API is so essential to internet business locales today.

E-commerce site use this APIs, because of 
- Security
- Speed
- Scalability
